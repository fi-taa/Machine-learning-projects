# Titanic Classification Project

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset is provided by Kaggle and contains information about passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not.

## Dataset

The dataset is provided in the `data/` directory:

- `train.csv`: The training dataset containing information about passengers, including their survival status (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived).
- `test.csv`: The test dataset used for making predictions. It contains passenger information without survival labels.
- `gender_submission.csv`: A sample submission file for Kaggle competitions, which you can use as a template for submitting predictions.

## Problem Description

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. A large number of passengers and crew members lost their lives in this tragic event. This project's goal is to use machine learning to predict whether a passenger would have survived or not based on various features.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following directory structure:


Certainly, here's an extended README.md file that includes information about the dataset, model results, and a brief description of the problem:

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: The raw dataset is available in the `data/` directory as `train.csv` and `test.csv`. You can perform feature engineering using `feature_engineering.py`.

2. **Model Training**: Use train_models.py to train different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, on the preprocessed training data. The trained models will be saved in the models/ directory.

Cross-Validation: To assess the generalization performance of the models, you can use cross-validation.py. This script performs k-fold cross-validation on each model using the training data.

Making Predictions: Once the models are trained, you can use them to make predictions on the test dataset (test.csv) using the saved models. The predictions will be saved in the predictions/ directory.

Model Evaluation: You can evaluate the model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1-score. You may choose to evaluate individual models or perform cross-validation.

Dependencies
